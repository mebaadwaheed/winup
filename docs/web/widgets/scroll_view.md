# ScrollView

The `ScrollView` component is a container that provides a scrollable area for its content. If the content inside a `ScrollView` exceeds its defined dimensions, scrollbars will appear. It renders as a `<div>` with `overflow: auto`.

## Usage

This is useful for displaying long lists of items or large blocks of text without taking up the entire page.

```python
from winup import web

@web.component
def LogViewer():
    log_entries = [f"Log entry #{i}: An event occurred." for i in range(50)]
    
    return web.ui.ScrollView(
        # You must provide a size for the scroll view to work,
        # otherwise it will just expand to fit its content.
        style={'height': '200px', 'border': '1px solid #ccc'},
        children=[
            web.ui.Label(entry) for entry in log_entries
        ]
    )
```

## Arguments
- `children` (list): A list of child components to render inside the scrollable area.
- `props` (dict, optional): A dictionary of additional HTML attributes.
- `**kwargs`: Keyword arguments are also treated as HTML attributes.

## Styling
The most important style properties for `ScrollView` are `height` and/or `width`. Without a constrained size, the component will simply grow to fit its content, and no scrollbars will appear. You can also add borders, padding, and other container styles.
